Create a simple delibot system based on micro-service architecture.

With this system, the user should be able to order for the delivery of groceries, food, books etc., from any registered stores/shops. User can also give rating/feedback on the delivery and delivery executive. In addition to this, the user can register them as delivery executives by submitting their details.
The system should have the capability to route the delivery to the appropriate delivery executive based on their location and availability.

Feel free to assume any functional requirements/attributes needed while implementing the solution. We expect the application to be exposed via REST endpoints.

Summary of Functional requirements are given below:

1. User should be able register themselves as delivery executive or a new user of the service or both.

2. User should be able to order for the delivery of any items from registered stores.

3. Users should be able to provide feedback on the delivery and the executive.

4. System should be able to route the delivery to an executive appropriately.

5. System should be able to list all the orders from the user as well as in delivery executive view.

Few non-functional requirements are

• There should be sufficient test coverage (unit / integration tests) and code quality/security checks.

• Service(s) should be observable, it should have sufficient logs and metrics.

• Service(s) should be containerized.

• Automate all stages within a CI/CD pipeline.

Nice to have:

• UI is optional but nice if you can create something quickly

Expected Artifacts:

• Architecture diagram and sequence diagram

• Database Design

• Code along with unit and integration test case

• Docker File

• Pipeline Script
